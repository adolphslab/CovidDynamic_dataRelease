Although restrictive public health behaviors such as social distancing help manage its impact, these behaviors can further sever our connections to people and institutions that affirm our identities. Three studies (N=1,195) validated a brief 10-item COVID-19 threat scale that assesses 1) realistic threats to physical or financial safety, and 2) symbolic threats to one\u2019s sociocultural identity. Studies reveal that both realistic and symbolic threat predict higher distress and lower wellbeing, and demonstrate convergent validity with other measures of threat sensitivity. Importantly, the two kinds of threat diverge in their relationship to restrictive public health behaviors: Realistic threat predicted greater self-reported adherence, whereas symbolic threat predicted less self-reported adherence to social-disconnection behaviors. Symbolic threat also predicted using creative ways to affirm identity even in isolation.

Consistent with our pre-registered predictions, deontological messages had modest effects across several measures of behavioral intentions, second-order beliefs, and impressions of the messenger, while virtue-based messages had modest effects on personal responsibility for preventing the spread. Overall, our preliminary results suggest that public health messaging focused on duties and responsibilities toward family, friends and fellow citizens will be most effective in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in the US.

According to theories regarding the social construction of stigma, we suspect that mislabeling COVID-19 as \u201cChinese Virus\u201d may lead to severe stigmatization against Chinese communities in the U.S., and the effect is expected to be heterogeneous based on people\u2019s political standpoint. Meanwhile, the mislabel may benefit the current administration by avoiding the public blame for its responsibilities in disease control and emergency management.","In three exploratory studies and one preregisteredreplication in a representative sample of US participants, we found  converging  evidence  that  compliance  with  official  recommendations  is  not related   to   epistemic   attitudes   such   as   beliefs   in   conspiracy   theories   and pseudoscience,  fear,  or  psychological  reactance.

As such, we are conducting qualitative interviews with a diverse cross-section of Americans.","Research on media framing effects on policy preferences is vast, but little work exists in health policy, and certainly less regarding COVID-19. Consequently, this study will examine: (1) the effects of exposure to competitive goal frames (public health vs. economic goals) on support for restrictions to social life, and (2) the moderating role played by melodramatic elements in the news.

Methods: We conducted a survey of 252 healthcare workers in Ecuador from April 10 to May 2, 2020. Results: In Ecuador, 32.54% of the sampled healthcare workers experienced distress disorder, and 28.17% had anxiety disorder. Compared to healthcare workers who were not sure where the virus originated, those who believed the virus was developed intentionally in a lab reported higher levels of distress and anxiety, and lower levels of job satisfaction and life satisfaction. Older healthcare workers and those who exercise more reported higher job satisfaction. Married healthcare workers, those who exercise more, and those not infected reported higher life satisfaction. Conclusion: This paper identifies belief in a COVID-19 conspiracy theory as an important predictor of distress, anxiety, and job and life satisfaction of healthcare workers. It enables mental health services to better target and help mentally vulnerable healthcare workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Aims: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have detrimental mental health consequences.

The results show that people who endorse COVID-19 conspiracy theories are indeed more likely to engage in stockpiling behaviors.","While waiting for a medicine-based response, governments face many difficult policy trade-offs in their efforts to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. It is well recognised that the success of any policy intervention in this (or any) area depends in part on how well the policy is positioned in these trade-offs to match citizen preferences (see Department of Health and Social Care 2020). However, little is known about citizen preferences over these possible dimensions and trade-offs of Covid-19 policy. Our proposed study addresses this gap for the UK and US by conducting a unique online conjoint survey experiment in two waves to identify citizen preferences.\n","Journalists frequently cover political issues using \u201cpartisan conflict\u201d or \u201cgame\u201d frames, which describe political events as sites for conflict between the two parties, or in terms of who \u201cwon\u201d or \u201clost,\u201d instead of in terms of the events\u2019 substantive importance. This study evaluates the effect of game or conflict frames on public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesize that conflict framing, and especially game framing, will exacerbate the partisan divide in beliefs and actions related to the pandemic.

Using location data from a large sample of smartphones, nationally representative consumer preference surveys, and government statistics, we measure the relative transmission risk benefit and social cost of closing 30 different location categories in the US. Our categories include types of shops, schools, entertainments, and public spaces. We rank categories by those which should face stricter regulation via dominance across eight dimensions of risk and importance and through composite indexes. We find that from February to March, there were larger declines in visits to locations that our measures imply should be closed first. We hope this analysis will help policymakers decide how to reopen their economies.","As COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented human health consequences.
