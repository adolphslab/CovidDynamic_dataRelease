The Covid-Dynamic study includes 6 experimental tasks:
● Pro-social Implicit Association Task (pro_iat)
● Multi-category Brief Implicit Association Task (bias)
● Multi-race Affective Misattribution Procedure (amp)
● COVID-related Trustworthiness Rating Task (tr_1s)
● Altruism Task (cvd_altt)
● Public Goods Game (cvd_pgg)
Each task-code and stimuli are provided in a separate folder. 

For record-keeping, we created a new index.html-file for each wave a task was deployed(see filenames).

For each task we provide the stimuli (excluding face-stimuli) in the respective task folder. In the biat, amp, and tr_1s participants were presented with different face-stimuli. These faces were extracted from licensed face databases (see below for a complete list of face-databases used in this study). Due to licensing constraints we do not provide these face stimuli with the code. Please contact the corresponding author Damian Stanley (dstanley@adelphi.edu) for more information.
